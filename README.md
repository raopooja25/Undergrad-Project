Smart Pill Dispenser
Abstract: With an increase in the number of health problems, there is a need for a device to maintain and monitor the medicines of an individual. Management of prescribed medicines can be difficult, especially for senior citizens. We have put forth a design of a smart pill dispenser which will remind patients to take their medications on time and avoid underdose, overdose and skipping medications. The device is a compact, inexpensive and portable assembly. It makes the process of taking medicines comparatively easier. By taking advantage of flexible scheduling provided by medication directions, the device makes the userâ€™s medication schedule easy to adhere and tolerant to tardiness whenever possible. The report describes the action-oriented design, major components, hardware, and software structures of the Smart Pill Dispenser.
